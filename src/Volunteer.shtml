                    Pregnancy Aid depends upon private contributes of time, money, and in-kind donations.

                    Our needs vary by location. Services provided by our volunteers include helping during office hours,
                    supporting our computer and media systems, making sure car seats and cribs are safe, and repairing
                    or cleaning baby items.
